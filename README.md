# ModelingJobsWithDataLogEntriesExample
Mentoring example, used to demonstrate scraping of data log entries on a list of jobs from a data source, then using extension methods to transform and output the data.

## Overview

This code simulates a job processing system where jobs have a list of data logs. The main operations performed are:

1. Simulate job creation with corresponding data logs.
2. Display sorted logs for each job.
3. Search for a specific criteria in logs (e.g. find where the letter 'z' occurs for the first time in the log entries).
